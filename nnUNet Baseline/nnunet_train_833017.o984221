WARNING:
You do not have a .condarc file in your home directory. This file is used
to configure the default location for conda environments and packages. By
default conda will store its environments and download packages in your
home directory. Home directory quotas are limited to 10GB and this is easily
reached with the installation of a few conda environments.

Before using conda on the SCC run this script to create a default .condarc
file that will use your /projectnb directory for storage:

    setup_scc_condarc.sh

The ~/.condarc file can be edited if needed, although the recommended method is
to use the "conda config" command. For more information, see this page:
https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/configuration/use-condarc.html

For more information on the .condarc file and the SCC please see:
